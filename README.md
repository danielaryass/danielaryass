# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am Daniel, a Junior Frontend Developer proficient in JavaScript and well versed in popular frameworks such as Laravel and Next JS. Beyond coding, I bring valuable experience as an IT Support professional. Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I am a highly motivated and dedicated individual.

With approximately one year of experience in IT Support, I am excited to pivot into the dynamic field of Front-End Development. To enhance my skills, I am currently immersed in a comprehensive bootcamp provided by Dicoding Indonesia, spanning from August of this year until January. My current skill set encompasses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
